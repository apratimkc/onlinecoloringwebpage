        <!-- Using MagicPencil -->
        <div class="faq-category">
            <h2>Using MagicPencil</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How does the tap-to-fill coloring work?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Our <strong>tap-to-fill technology</strong> makes coloring easy! Simply select a color from the palette, then tap or click any section of the image you want to fill. That section instantly fills with your chosen color. To change a color, just select a different color and tap that section again. It's that simple—perfect even for young children who are still developing fine motor control.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What are gradients and how do I use them?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer"><strong>Gradients</strong> are smooth color transitions that create beautiful blending effects. To use gradients, click the gradient icon in the advanced tools panel on the right. You'll see preset gradient options in various directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal). Click a gradient preset, then tap any section of your image to apply that gradient effect. Gradients are perfect for creating realistic skies, water, flowers, and artistic effects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How do patterns work?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">MagicPencil offers <strong>5 fun patterns</strong>: Stripes, Dots, Checkerboard, Hearts, and Stars. To use patterns, first select a color from the main palette (this determines the pattern color), then click the pattern icon and choose your pattern style. Tap any section to fill it with your colored pattern. Patterns are great for adding texture and visual interest to clothing, backgrounds, and decorative elements.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I download and print my colored images?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Click the <strong>Download button</strong> (usually at the top of the coloring page) to save your colored masterpiece as a high-quality PNG image. The downloaded image saves directly to your device. You can then print it at home on regular printer paper or photo paper, share it digitally via email or messaging apps, save it to your photo gallery, or even use it as wallpaper or in digital scrapbooks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What if I want to start over?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Click the <strong>CLEAR button</strong> to reset your coloring page back to its original uncolored state. A confirmation dialog will appear asking if you're sure you want to clear all colors (since this action cannot be undone). Click "Yes, Clear" to remove all colors and start fresh. This is useful if you want to try a completely different color scheme or let someone else have a turn coloring the same image.</p>

            <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What devices work with MagicPencil?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">MagicPencil works on <strong>all modern devices</strong> including desktop computers (Windows, Mac, Linux), laptops, tablets (iPad, Android tablets, Amazon Fire tablets), and smartphones (iPhone, Android phones). The site is fully responsive, meaning it automatically adapts to your screen size for the best experience. We recommend tablets for the best balance of screen size and portability.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">What web browsers are supported?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">MagicPencil works best on <strong>modern web browsers</strong> including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge (the latest 2 versions of each). We recommend keeping your browser updated to the latest version for the best performance and security. Internet Explorer is not supported as it's an outdated browser.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Do I need an internet connection?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes, you need an <strong>internet connection</strong> to access MagicPencil and load coloring pages. However, once a page is loaded, you can color offline. Your colored creation stays in your browser as long as you keep that browser tab/window open. We're considering adding offline functionality in the future, but currently, internet access is required.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Why isn't my coloring page saving?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">MagicPencil <strong>doesn't automatically save your work</strong> to our servers (since we don't use accounts). Your colored image exists only in your current browser session. If you close the tab, refresh the page, or navigate away, your coloring will be lost. To save your work permanently, click the Download button to save the image to your device before leaving the page. We don't save images to protect children's privacy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">The website isn't working properly. What should I do?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">If you experience technical issues, try these <strong>troubleshooting steps</strong>: (1) Refresh the page (press F5 or Ctrl+R / Cmd+R), (2) Clear your browser cache and cookies, (3) Try a different web browser, (4) Ensure your browser is updated to the latest version, (5) Check that JavaScript is enabled in your browser settings, (6) Try accessing the site from a different device or network.

        <!-- For Parents and Teachers -->
        <div class="faq-category">
            <h2>For Parents and Teachers</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can I use MagicPencil in my classroom?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Absolutely! Teachers are <strong>welcome and encouraged</strong> to use MagicPencil in classrooms. Our platform works great for art classes, reward time, indoor recess, early finisher activities, alphabet learning (using our A-Z coloring pages), vocabulary building, and calming activities for anxious students. No account or permission is needed. MagicPencil works on school Chromebooks, iPads, and desktop computers. Since we don't require logins, it's perfect for shared classroom devices.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Are there educational benefits to digital coloring?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Digital coloring provides <strong>numerous educational benefits</strong> including fine motor skill development (even with tap-to-fill), hand-eye coordination, color recognition and theory, decision-making skills, pattern recognition, following directions, focus and concentration, patience and persistence, creative expression, and screen time that's productive rather than passive. Unlike video games or videos, coloring is an active, creative process that engages children's minds.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">How is screen time with MagicPencil different from other screen time?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">MagicPencil offers <strong>active, creative screen time</strong> rather than passive consumption. Children make decisions, express creativity, practice skills, and create something unique—similar to traditional coloring with crayons, but digital. There's no addictive game mechanics, no autoplay videos, no endless scrolling. Children are actively engaged in creating art. Many parents and teachers find digital coloring to be a healthy screen time option that balances technology use with educational value.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3 class="faq-question">Can multiple children use MagicPencil on the same device?</h3>
                <p class="faq-answer">Yes! Since MagicPencil <strong>doesn't require accounts</strong>, any number of children can use the same device. Each child simply chooses a coloring page and colors it. When they're done, they can download their creation, then the next child can choose their page. For classrooms with shared devices, this makes MagicPencil especially convenient. Just remind children to download their work before starting a new page!</p>
