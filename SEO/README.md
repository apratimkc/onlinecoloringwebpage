## SEO Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1) - CRITICAL
**Goal:** Make site discoverable by Google

1. Rebrand ColorTap → MagicPencil
2. Create robots.txt & sitemap.xml
3. Set up Google Analytics & Search Console
4. Fix H1 tags and add canonical tags

**Why First:** Without this, Google can't properly find and index your site.

---

### Phase 2: On-Page Optimization (Week 1-2) - HIGH
**Goal:** Optimize every page for target keywords

1. Update all meta tags (title, description, Open Graph)
2. Add Schema.org structured data
3. Optimize image alt text
4. Create Open Graph images
5. Add breadcrumb navigation

**Why Second:** Once Google can find you, make sure pages are optimized to rank.

---

### Phase 3: Content Expansion (Week 2-3) - ONGOING
**Goal:** Reach 100+ images with unique metadata

1. Add remaining 93 images
2. Generate SEO metadata for all images
3. Update sitemap
4. Ensure all category pages work

**Why Third:** More quality content = more ranking opportunities.

---

### Phase 4: Legal & Compliance (Week 2) - REQUIRED
**Goal:** Meet legal requirements (EU GDPR, US COPPA)

1. Implement cookie consent banner
2. Review privacy policy
3. Add/update Terms of Service
4. Ensure AdSense compliance

**Why Fourth:** Legal compliance is non-negotiable, but site can launch while finalizing.

---

### Phase 5: Advanced SEO (Week 3+) - NICE TO HAVE
**Goal:** Maximize rankings and traffic

1. Build internal linking
2. Create 404 page
3. Optimize for featured snippets
