**New Recommended Title (includes painting):**
"Free Online Coloring & Painting for Kids - MagicPencil"

**Old Meta Description:**
"100+ free coloring pages for kids ages 2-14. Just tap to fill with colors, gradients, and patterns! No login, no downloads - instant creative fun."

**New Recommended Description (includes painting):**
"100+ free coloring and painting pages for kids ages 2-14. Just tap to fill with colors, gradients, and patterns! No login, no downloads - instant creative fun."

### Content Updates
