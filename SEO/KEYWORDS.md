### Primary Painting Keywords

| Keyword | Search Volume Estimate | Competition | Priority |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|----------|
| free online painting for kids | Medium-High (5,000-10,000) | Medium | **HIGH** |
| online painting games for children | Medium (2,000-5,000) | Low-Medium | **HIGH** |
| kids painting online free | Medium (2,000-5,000) | Medium | **HIGH** |

**Examples:**

### Long-Tail Painting Keywords

| tap to paint games for kids | Very Low | **MEDIUM** |

### Why "Painting" Keywords Matter

1. **User Intent Overlap:** Parents searching "painting for kids" often want the same thing as "coloring" - a creative digital activity
2. **Lower Competition:** "Painting" keywords have less competition than "coloring" (fewer competitors targeting them)
3. **Semantic Relevance:** Your site DOES offer painting features (gradients, patterns, fill colors)
4. **Voice Search:** Kids/parents may say "find painting games" more naturally than "coloring"

### Implementation Strategy

**Meta Tags:** Include both "coloring" AND "painting" in descriptions
- Example: "Free online coloring and painting for kids - Tap to fill with colors"

**Content:** Use both terms naturally throughout the site
- "Color and paint online"
- "Choose your coloring or painting page"
- "Creative coloring and painting activities"

**Alt Text:** Include "painting" variants
- "Dog painting page for kids"
- "Princess coloring and painting online"

## Geographic/Language Keywords

**Scandinavia Focus:**
- While primary language is English, consider these searches:
  - "coloring pages for kids english"
  - "american coloring games" (non-US English speakers may search this)

**USA Focus:**
- "free coloring pages usa"
- "online coloring activities america"
